I find github a great source to complete our programming assignments. Using this platform can help us the students share ideas and ways of completing programs. I learned how the repositories can store assignments, it is great way of keeping them in a secured way in this Github platform. One thing I'm still a little confuse is how we can share or look for other user's projects around the Github community.I hope I can keep learning more about Github throughout the course, I'm looking forward to it.
